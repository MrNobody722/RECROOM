This changes your name it doesn't show on your name tag for other people but when you join a room it says whatever u put as your name,
instead of the normal player join message it displays in chat displays on gifts and a lot of other stuff. 

when you are in your dorm on CE go to string and enable utf-16.
search your name if nothing comes up search the first word in your name then ur ctrl-a to change all of the values at once to whatever you want your name to be.

Credit; One again another simple CE value switch SO NO CREDIT >:(
