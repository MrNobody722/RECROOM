This will teach you how to use ce in rec room either using WinD64 or EFIguard
You can use any Custom Cheat Engine you want but this one I made is Undetected https://anonfiles.com/ucaec7Gcy5/bin_rar if you don't know how to use anon files just don't download it as an iso.
 You can  either use WinD64 https://github.com/katlogic/WindowsD/releases or Efiguard https://github.com/Mattiwatti/EfiGuard
If using WinD64 U cant have valorant if you do uninstall riot client open it then type y then n
open CE and turn on all of the settings in extra then press ok it should say dbk64 loaded
Run WinD64 and uninstall it if it doesn't give u that option go to syestem32 and delete the WinD64 file it made
Then just connect to rec room and u can use cheat engine to do stuff
I recommend using WinD64.

This does not mean that they made every CE bypass or anything close to that
Krane made this "method and cheat engine"
Kat made Windows64 
Matti made Efiguard
