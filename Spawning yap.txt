if you want to spawn in stuff just weapons/props and that just swap your [ShareCamera] to it and it should work (wont work with bosses and non prop items put utf 16 on too 
heres the boss method now
so you spawn in the clothing customizer in your dorm turn off uft-16 then value type string scan [FeedbackTool] and swap it to [ClothingCustomizerTool] then go on rec room and use and recall the clothing thing in your dorm then go on cheat engine turn on utf -16 then scan [ClothingCustomizerMarkerSet] to [WHAT EVER VALUE]
