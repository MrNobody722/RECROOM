To swap clothing on your ce go to array of byte and paste the hex of the item use ctrl a to move all of the values and swap all of them at the same time to 
whatever you want, then go to the shop and chang you skin color or something to reload your outfit. 
To get these values go into the recroom data and open resource.assests with a Hex Editor or VS dont change anything in this though.
you can use ctrl f to find the clothing you want. 
if you find the right one there should be a string of letters that u can see after the values now copy the hex for the string. (I linked a Video)
